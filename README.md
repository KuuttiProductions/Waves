# Waves

Waves is an _utility_ app for macOS. It adds _**amazing**_ shader effects for you screen!
Maybe you can use it to prank someone by installing it on their computer something?

### How to quit the app

Waves doesn't have icon in dock and cannot be closed from force quit menu. You'll have to _terminate it_ from the menubar icon (just keep clicking...)

### How it works

It's pretty interesting actually.
Waves does a continuos screen capture and adds the shader effects in real-time.
Then it renders the new image to a full-screen borderless window.
It is certainly not the most efficient solution but I couldn't figure out anything else.
